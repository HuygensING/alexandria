    "This download installs a zip file called `alexandria-app`; unpack it in a directory of your choice. Keep in mind, though, the importance of a good \"filesystem hygiene\". In short: create a relevant folder in a place that you can easily reach and make sure the folder is [properly named](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DiXiT-eu/collatex-tutorial/blob/master/unit1/Command_line.ipynb#File-naming-conventions). We advise you to create a separate folder for Alexandria, named something like `alexandria-test`. You can create it anywhere you like, but an appropriate place is your Home directory. "
