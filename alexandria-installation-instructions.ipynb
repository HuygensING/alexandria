The folder contains three subfolders: a `lib` folder with the fat jar, a `bin` folder with the alexandria scripts for linux and windows, and an `example` folder. You can ignore the first two folders, but the `example` folder comes in handy if you want some templates for the views.\n",

    "You may unpack the zip in a directory of your choice. Keep in mind, though, the importance of a good \"filesystem hygiene\". In short: create a relevant folder in a place that you can easily reach and make sure the folder is [properly named](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DiXiT-eu/collatex-tutorial/blob/master/unit1/Command_line.ipynb#File-naming-conventions). We advise you to create a separate folder (which you may call something like `alexandria`). You can create it anywhere you like, but an appropriate place is your Home directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within your `alexandria` folder, you can create a subfolder `transcriptions` to store your own transcriptions and a subfolder `views` to store any views you're going to define. This ensures you have all your files in one place and easy to reach."
