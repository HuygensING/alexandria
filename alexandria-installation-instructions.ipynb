    "Before we start, make sure your file system is in good order and that you adhere to the [\"file system hygiene\"](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DiXiT-eu/collatex-tutorial/blob/master/unit1/Command_line.ipynb#The-hierarchical-file-system) principles. We advise you to create a separate folder for your work with _Alexandria_ (which you may call something like `alexandria`). You can create this folder anywhere you like, but an appropriate place is your Home directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within your new `alexandria` folder, you can create a subfolder `transcriptions` to store your own transcriptions and a subfolder `views` to store any views you're going to define. This ensures you have all your files in one place and easy to reach."

Unpack the zip file in your `alexandria` folder. The zip contains three subfolders: a `lib` folder with the fat jar, a `bin` folder with the alexandria scripts for linux and windows, and an `example` folder. You can ignore the first two folders, but the `example` folder comes in handy later if you need a template to define views on your text."
