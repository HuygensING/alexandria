## About the tutorial
This _Alexandria_ tutorial is a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook contains blocks of text and small snippets of code: commands that you give to your version of _Alexandria_. You can run these commands from within the notebook. The notebook, in other words, is a secure environment for you to play around with and get to know _Alexandria_.

Do make sure you follow the checklist below:

### Requirements

- Make sure you are okay with working on the [command line](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DiXiT-eu/collatex-tutorial/blob/master/unit1/Command_line.ipynb).

- Get familiar with the [Jupyter Notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DiXiT-eu/collatex-tutorial/blob/master/unit1/Jupyter_notebook.ipynb) environment.

- Check if you have [installed Alexandria](https://cdn.huygens.knaw.nl/alexandria/alexandria-app.zip). 

- Download the [tutorial](link to zip) and unpack the zip file in a logical place in your filesystem.

- Make sure you are running this notebook within the `tutorial` folder. 

- Install [Sublime Text 3](https://github.com/HuygensING/TAG/blob/develop/TAGML/syntax-hilite.README.md). Sublime Text 3 is a cross-platform editor that has syntax highlighting for TAGML. In this tutorial we work with a number of example TAGML transcriptions. We recommend you use it to view and create TAGML transcriptions; it makes your work a lot easier.
